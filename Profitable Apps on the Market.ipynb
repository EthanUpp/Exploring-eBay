    "This project is to investigate the Apple (iOS) app store and Google Play (Android) markets in terms of which apps are most profitable. The parameters for this research include cost, language and user interactions. Cost will be sorted as free to play apps both with and without ads, and apps that cost money with and without ads. In terms of language we plan on isolating and analyzing apps designed for the English speaking demographic and user interactions will be determined through number of downloads and ratings of the apps themselves.\n",

    "With this information we know that the most popular category by a vast majority is Games. However, just because the iOS store is flooded with games designed for fun doesn't mean they're in the most demand. It's hard to tell from this data alone whether or not an app profile for any of these genres would be recommended. There is a clear bias towards the Games genre but additional data such as downloads, daily users and other trends would be needed to make a decision."

These two statistics suggest a market with high downloads and not many competitors to overcome."
